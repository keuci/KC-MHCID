    <h1>My Experience Learning to Code </h1>
     <p>Learning to code is slow-going and difficult but fascinating. The power! The mental gymnatstics! A new way of thinking! Another challenging part of this process has been asking for help. I am used to being self-sufficent, but what I have realized is that help is handy, help is good, help makes learning richer.</p>
