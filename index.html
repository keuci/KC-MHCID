    <h1>My Experience Learning to Code </h1>
     <p>Learning to code is slow-going and difficult but fascinating. So much of the battle is embracing the challenge! It is truly like learning a new language - it is difficult but amazing in what doors in can open.</p>
<p>Another challenging part of this process has been asking for help. I am used to being self-sufficent, but what I have realized is that help is handy, help is good, help makes learning richer. </p>
